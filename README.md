# Goldy's-Market

This project is a UMN online marketplace, similar to eBay, designed exclusively for students. It provides a centralized, trusted platform where students can buy and sell items commonly exchanged on campus, such as textbooks, furniture, electronics, and dorm essentials.

The platform is meant to replace informal methods of student sales (e.g., Snapchat stories, group chats, or third-party marketplace apps) with a structured, searchable, and secure environment tailored to student needs.

Project made as part of the Social Coding Club at the UMN.
